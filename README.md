# Remote Control

* Original project from [here](https://github.com/Bediveren/RemoteControllerCsharp)  
* Requires .NET 4.0 or newer.    

* This project is to create application remote support like team viewer,anyedesk, vnc, etc.
* Remote will control Client and Client send screen to Remote. Remote and Client connected with Server to send and receive data;


Notes:  
- Still have many bugs.
- Mouse movement laggy.
- Sometimes crash.
- Confused with server sometimes not sending correct data.
